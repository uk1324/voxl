Left recursion is solved inside the code not in the specification.

Maybe add a string concatenation operator.

Don't know if I should have an empty stmt like ";". It is useful in c like languages for loops like while(doSomething());
but this will be impossible with this language. Or I could add it to the syntax of the while loop but that would look stupid.

FactorA ::= Number FactorB
FactorB ::= (+ FactorB Number) | Nothing

    <stmt> ::= <exprStmt>
		   
<exprStmt> ::= <expr> ";"
		   
   <digit> ::= "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" | "0"
  <number> ::= <digit>*
		 
    <expr> ::= <factor>
		 
  <factor> ::= <number> ("+" <number>)*
