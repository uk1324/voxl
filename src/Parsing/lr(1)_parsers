LR stands for left to right reverse rightmost deriviation.
1 means one symbol of lookahead.
Even though LR(k) where k > 1 parsers can parse more grammars than LR(1) parsers. They can only parse the same set of languages.

LR parsers are based on two main actions shift and reduce.
Shifting moves to the next symbol and changes the current state.
Reducing pops items of the stack and pushes a new nonterminal and moves to a new state.
